                    Hi there! My name is Lucy and I am from White Plains, NY. I have 2 older sisters, Sydney(24) 
                    and Melanie(22), and I am going to turn 20 on July 20th 2024! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I attend Colby College in Waterville, ME and I am studying computer science. Outside of my studies 
                    I enjoy playing rugby and lacrosse, as well as snowboarding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I chose to study computer science in 6th grade after I had completed the Girls Who Code program.
                    <br> 
                    My dream is to work for an outdoor apparel company like <b>Burton</b>, <b>Patagonia</b>, 
                    or <b>The North Face</b>. 
                </p>
